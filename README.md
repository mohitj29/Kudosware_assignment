Assignment

You need to develop a website where  a user can search through N number of pdf files. The user will enter one or more keywords and on the next page it will show all the pdfs which contains those keywords.

If user enters:
  1. Crime: Results should be all the documents with crime in it.
  2. Crime AND road: Results should have all the documents which have crime and road both in it but if the user keeps scrolling down and there are no documents left with crime and road both in it, it should start listing all documents with just crime or just road in it.
  3. Crime OR road: Results should have all the documents which have either of one.
  4. “Crime on road”: Results should have specific phrases in the documents.
  * What if a user enters “crime on road” AND bike - be Creative and come up with a solution.

We have attached the website skeleton for your reference. There should be 2 pages; one with just the search bar and second with the results. Users should be able to add or remove keywords from the second page and results should update accordingly.

Assignment will be evaluated based on:
  1. Implementing all the functionality mentioned above.
  2. A good UI ( highly preferred).
  3. Creativity.
  4. Additional functions.
